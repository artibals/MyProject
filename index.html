           <h1>Plate laser cutting</h1>
           <div class="first-block">
           <p>One of the our priority directions activity on the Ukrainian market is 
           provision of services on metal cutting with laser. We use one of the most powerful 
           and most up-to-date laser machines that allows us cutting stainless steel with thickness up to 15 mm, 
           aluminum – up to 8 mm and black metal up to 20 mm. 
           Due to maximum productive capacity and high quality features, 
           the equipment of our metalworking complex perfectly suits for both processing of individual orders and
           big batches of products. Along with the automation of production, 
           an important element for us still remains the professional approach and 
           careful attitude of the employees to the laser cutting results.</p>

           <h2>Technology of plate metal laser cutting</h2>
           <div class="second-block">
           <p>Metalworking with laser is an automated and highly-technological process that has
           a range of important advantages if compared to other ways of metal cutting:</p>
           <p>
           Optional part configuration – the geometric form of parts and part contour complexity level, 
           designed for cutting by laser, are actually restricted only by imagination of designer or design engineer. 
           The technology of metal laser cutting allows making in the material openings of very small size, 
           with diameter from 1 mm.
           Quality cutting surface, no residual deformation on the part – process computerization and 
           lack of mechanical influence allows avoiding residual deformation of cutting contours, 
           as well as minimizing temporary deformations, as during the laser cutting there are no immediate contact with the 
           metal surface. Moreover, owing to laser temperature features the part edge tempering that enhances its strength, takes place.
           High precision of laser cutting equipment – there is no need in further mechanical bringing of the part to the set dimensions, as precision of laser cutting is 0.1 mm.
           Low material waste – laser metal cutting is performed subject to the ready schemes and drawings that makes the process almost wasteless due to minimization 
           of trimmings and remains. Laser metal cutting allows substantial economy with small product batches as it is more practical and reasonable to perform laser metal tailoring 
           than to additionally purchase quite expensive casting molds and dies, or matrices, especially for small-batch production.
           Speed and automation of laser cutting process – automated metal cutting differs from other ways with its speed that is a substantial advantage, especially for performance of large-scale industrial orders. 
           Substantial reduction of human factor part due to production automation allows greatly optimizing expenses and simultaneously increasing precision of laser tailoring and final quality of products.
           Laser cutting of various metals – Laser cutting does not deform thin plate metal and is safe for materials with mirror and glazed surface.
           Laser ray gives opportunity for easy performance of additional constructional elements and part marking that simplifies further construction bending, folding and welding. It is also possible to perform technological laser engraving of the part.</p>
